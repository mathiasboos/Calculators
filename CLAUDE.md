# Calculators — Project Notes

## What this project is

Offline, dependency-free Swedish pension and salary calculators built as standalone HTML files. Each file is self-contained — no build step, no server, no external dependencies beyond fonts and charting libraries loaded via CDN where needed.

## Key 2026 constants

| Constant | Value |
|---|---|
| IBB (Inkomstbasbelopp) | 83,400 kr |

Add further constants here as they come up (e.g. PBB, takbelopp, skiktgräns).

## Source of truth for formulas

When fixing or verifying calculation logic, **treat Excel as the source of truth**. If a formula in an HTML file diverges from the reference Excel model, the HTML is wrong.

## Git workflow

This folder is a git repository. Commit all changes with clear, descriptive messages. Prefer separate commits for separate concerns (e.g. don't bundle a bug fix with a visual tweak). Use `git revert` rather than rewriting history when undoing changes.
